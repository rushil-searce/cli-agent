"""The harness — the object that owns the conversation.

Tier 1 had nothing here, and `cli.py` held a bare `list`. That is fine while the
transcript has exactly one reader. It stops being fine the moment something else
needs it, and in Tier 2 three things do:

* **persistence** must write entries as they appear
* **orphan repair** must scan the transcript after an interrupt
* **the steering queue** must add to it between turns

`python/TIER-1.md` named this directly: orphan repair "needs a harness that owns
`messages`". So one object owns it, and the loop stays a function over a list.

**Nothing flows downward from a UI.** A listener subscribes and is called; it
cannot reach in and drive the loop. When you type while the agent works, the text
is *queued* on the harness and the loop picks it up when it is ready. That
strictness is why Tau's whole agent-to-UI bridge is 99 lines, and why the same
agent could later run on a server with the UI somewhere else.

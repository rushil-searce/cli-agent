"""The agent loop.

Ask qs to the model instead of knowing answers. If it requested tools, run them
and report back. Repeat until it stops asking. That is the whole idea, and it is
why this file is short.

**It should stay short.** If this file is growing, something in it is a *decision*
rather than the *mechanism* — may I run this, should I compact, is this output too
long — and decisions belong to a caller, reached through a callback. Pi's loop is
792 lines inside 109,000; Tau's is 318 inside 36,000. Neither grew as its system did.

Tier 1 note: this yields the twelve *provider* events straight through, because
that is the only vocabulary that exists yet. Tier 2 introduces the ten coarser
*agent* events (`agent_start`, `turn_end`, `tool_execution_start`, …) and this
will emit those instead — which is also what lets a UI show tool activity while
it happens rather than after the fact.

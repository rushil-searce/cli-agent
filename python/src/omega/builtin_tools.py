"""The three Tier-1 tools: read a file, write a file, run a command.

Ported from the working logic in the repo-root `agent.py`, with three changes:

* **output goes through a budget** (`truncate.py`) — the failure that ends a
  session fastest
* **failures raise** rather than returning a flag, so there is one way to fail
  and the loop owns the conversion
* **a failing command carries its output with it**, because "exited with code 1"
  tells the model nothing it can act on

Deliberately absent at this tier: `edit`, path confinement, and any approval
check. Nothing here is safe to point at a directory you care about — run it in a
scratch folder. `../docs/00-concepts/security.md` explains what Tier 2 adds and why.

"""A print-based REPL.

Deliberately **not** a terminal UI. At Tier 2 a TUI would still hide more than it
shows; plain `print` keeps every event visible. A real UI arrives at Tier 3, and
it will subscribe to exactly the events this file already reads — that is the
test of whether the vocabulary was designed for a renderer or for a printer.

`--fake` runs the whole agent against scripted responses — no key, no network,
no credits. It exercises the same loop, the same tools, and the same streaming
path as the real thing.

"""The four file/shell tools: read, write, edit, run.

Tier 1 had three of these and no fence around any of them. Tier 2 adds `edit`
and puts all of them inside one:

* **paths go through `paths.py`** — one confinement check, not four (failure #4)
* **writes go through `file_lock.py`** — one lock per resolved file (failure #8)
* **file I/O happens in a thread** — a synchronous `read_text` on a large file
  blocks the whole event loop, and it is also what makes the lock load-bearing
  rather than decorative
* **`run_shell` has a timeout** and honours cancellation, so a hung command is
  survivable

Tools are built by a **factory**, not declared as module constants. The root has
to be decided by the caller: baking `Path.cwd()` in at import time makes it
impossible to test two roots in one process, and gives `--fake` in a temp
directory the wrong fence.

Still true, and stated rather than implied: **`run_shell` is not confined by any
of this.** `cd .. && cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` walks straight out, and parsing shell
commands to prevent that is a game you lose. The shell is covered by the
approval gate instead, and real containment is Tier 3+ sandboxing — for which
`prepare_shell` below is the seam.

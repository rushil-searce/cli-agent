"""Two views of history — anatomy.md #20.

What you *see* and what gets *sent* are not the same list. Tier 1 conflated them:
`messages` was both the transcript and the request payload, so anything unusable
by a provider had to be either kept and sent, or thrown away entirely.

The distinction earns its keep immediately. A turn that failed mid-stream leaves
an assistant message with no content and a `stop_reason` of `error`. It belongs
in the transcript — you asked something and it broke, and hiding that makes the
session a lie — but sending it back is at best noise and at worst a rejected
request.

**This is the simpler sibling of the seam compaction uses at Tier 3.** Same idea,
same signature: take what is kept, return what to send. `transform_context` is
where the 880-line version goes; `convert_to_llm` is where this five-line version
goes. That both exist now, with the smaller one doing real work, is what makes
the larger one an addition later rather than a redesign.

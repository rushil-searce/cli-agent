"""What a tool is.

A tool is the only way the model can affect anything. It writes a request; this
layer decides whether and how to honour it.

Two decisions here are worth more than they look:

**Tools raise on failure.** They do not return an error flag. Pi states this as a
rule (`packages/agent/src/types.ts`: "Throw on failure instead of encoding errors
in `content`") and it is the better convention because there is exactly one way
to fail — a tool author cannot get it subtly wrong. The loop catches and converts
the exception into a normal tool result the model can read.

**`content` and `details` are separate.** `content` goes to the model and costs
tokens; `details` goes to a UI and costs nothing. Nothing reads `details` at
Tier 1 — it exists so that when a diff renderer arrives it has somewhere to put
a full colourised diff while the model still receives "3 lines changed".

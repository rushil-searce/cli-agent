"""The neutral message model.

Every provider translates its own wire format into these types on the way in and
out. Nothing above the provider layer ever sees a vendor-shaped object — that is
the entire point of the layer, and the reason adding a second provider later does
not touch the loop.

Shapes follow Tau's `tau_agent/messages.py`, which in turn follows Pi's
`packages/ai/src/types.ts`. Where two independent implementations agree, that
agreement is treated as the architecture rather than a coincidence.

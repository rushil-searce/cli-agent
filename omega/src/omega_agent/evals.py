"""A smoke eval: does the whole thing still work end to end?

Distinct from the test suite, and the distinction is the point. The tests check
*units* against fakes: does the loop stop on content, does confinement refuse a
symlink. This checks the *agent* against a task: told to create a file, does a
file appear.

It is deliberately tiny. A smoke eval that takes ten minutes is a smoke eval
nobody runs, and its job is only to catch the class of breakage where every unit
still passes and yet the assembled thing does nothing — a tool registered under
the wrong name, an approval gate refusing everything, a system prompt that
stopped mentioning the tools.

Run it:

    uv run python -m omega.evals            # scripted, offline, free
    uv run python -m omega.evals --real     # against the configured provider

`anatomy.md:400` notes this shares its driver with terminal-bench. The driver is
`headless.py`; this is one task pointed at it.

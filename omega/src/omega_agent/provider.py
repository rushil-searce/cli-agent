"""The provider contract.

**This file is the whole point of Tier 1.**

Note where it lives: in the core package, next to the loop — not inside
`providers/`. The consumer defines the interface and adapters conform to it.
Reverse that, and Anthropic's shape becomes the shape of the system; adding a
second provider would then mean editing the loop, which is exactly the failure
this layer exists to prevent.

One method. In: which model, the standing instructions, the conversation, the
available tools, and a way to stop. Out: a stream of neutral events.

Everything a provider must guarantee is listed in `events.py`. The interface
itself stays this small on purpose — if a fake implementation of it is hard to
write, the interface is too big. `providers/fake.py` is that check.

"""Retry with backoff — beginner failure #5.

One HTTP 429 and Tier 1 threw away the whole run, including twenty round trips
of progress. The fix is small; *where* it goes is the part worth getting right.

**It lives below the event boundary.** `04-boundaries-and-layout.md:102` lists it
as one of the four promises Layer 1 makes Layer 2: "retries happen *below* this
line and are invisible above it." The loop never learns that a request was
attempted three times, which is why retry can be added, tuned, or replaced
without anything above the adapter changing.

**A stream can only be retried before it has emitted anything.** This is the
constraint that makes streaming retry different from request/response retry: once
500 tokens have gone upward, restarting produces them a second time. So the
adapter counts what it has yielded and stops being allowed to retry after the
first event. A failure after that point is reported as an error event carrying
the partial content — which is the Tier 1 behaviour, unchanged.

**Only some failures are worth retrying.** A 429 or a 503 is the server saying
"not now"; a 400 is the server saying "not ever, that request is wrong". Retrying
the second wastes time and hides the bug.

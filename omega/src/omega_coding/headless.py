"""Run the agent without a keyboard — anatomy.md #35.

A prompt goes in, the finished transcript comes out. No REPL, no prompting, no
terminal.

`anatomy.md:400` makes the case for building it now rather than later: **this is
also the terminal-bench interface.** Build it once, use it twice. Anything that
wants to drive omega programmatically — an eval, a benchmark, a subagent at
Tier 3+ — wants exactly this function, and a subagent *is* this function called
from inside a tool.

The one thing worth being careful about is approvals. Headless means nobody is
watching, and `ApprovalPolicy` with no asker denies by default for exactly that
reason. So a caller has to say `approve=True` explicitly. It is a keyword with no
default because "the tools silently did nothing" is a miserable way to discover
you forgot.

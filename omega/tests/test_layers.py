"""The layer boundaries, enforced instead of described.

Until Tier 2's restructure, "nothing points upward" was a sentence in
`dev-notes/03-architecture/04-boundaries-and-layout.md`. One flat package cannot
check it — every module can see every other one, and the rule survives on
discipline alone. Three packages make it mechanically checkable, so it should be
checked, and it should fail loudly the first time somebody takes a shortcut.

    omega_ai      knows one vendor's wire format, and nothing else
    omega_agent   knows messages, events, tools, turns. Not files. Not vendors.
    omega_coding  knows files, shells, policy, the screen

Imports are read with `ast`, not `grep`, and that distinction is load-bearing:
every one of these packages *mentions* the others in its module docstring while
importing none of them. A textual search reports those as violations, which is
how an architecture test becomes something people switch off.

"""The edit tool, and the write race it shares with write_file.

Tier 1 could only rewrite whole files. Fine at fifty lines; hopeless at two
thousand, where handing the model back its own file and asking for a full copy
burns tokens and invites transcription errors.

The design decision worth defending is **uniqueness**. `edit` refuses when
`old_text` matches more than once, rather than replacing the first match. A
model that meant the second occurrence and silently got the first has made a
wrong edit that reports success — the worst available outcome, because nothing
downstream can detect it. Refusing costs one turn.

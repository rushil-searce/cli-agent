# omega

A terminal coding agent, built from scratch in layers.

Named after a physics letter, following [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) and
[Tau](https://github.com/huggingface/tau) — the two MIT-licensed agents this is studied from.
Written independently, not forked.

**Currently at Tier 2 — "it is usable."** 4,654 lines of source, 289 tests, all offline.

* **[`READING-ORDER.md`](READING-ORDER.md) — start here.** All 30 files in the order to read them,
  one line each, plus the questions to hold while reading.
* [`TIER-1.md`](TIER-1.md) — what the first tier does, and what it deliberately left out
* [`TIER-2.md`](TIER-2.md) — what this tier adds, and where each remaining gap plugs in at Tier 3

Tier 1 proved the loop terminates. Tier 2 makes it safe to point at a real repository: it can be
interrupted without corrupting the conversation, it remembers across restarts, it asks before it
destroys anything, and its provider abstraction is no longer a claim but a measured result.

## Run it

```bash
uv sync

uv run omega --fake                 # scripted responses — no key, no network, no credits
uv run omega                        # Anthropic; needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in ../.env
uv run omega --provider openai      # OpenAI Chat Completions
uv run omega --resume               # continue the most recent session here
```

`--fake` is not a stub. It drives the entire agent — loop, harness, tools, streaming, approvals —
through `FakeProvider`, so you can watch the whole thing work without spending anything.

Useful flags: `--yes` approves tool calls automatically (it does **not** disable the
refuse-outright list), `--no-save` skips writing a session, `--session ID` resumes a specific one,
and `--base-url` points the OpenAI adapter at a local server:

```bash
uv run omega --provider openai --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1   # Ollama, free
```

Drop an `OMEGA.md` in the working directory and its contents are appended to the system prompt,
so project conventions stop being something you retype.

## Check it

```bash
uv run pytest -q                    # 289 tests, ~1.7s, fully offline
uv run mypy --strict src
uv run ruff check .
uv run python -m omega.evals        # smoke eval: does the assembled agent still work?
```

The test suite never touches the network. Every provider call is faked at the interface boundary —
which is why `providers/fake.py` was written before the real adapter — and the two vendor SDKs are
faked one layer lower, in `tests/stub_anthropic.py` and `tests/stub_openai.py`, so the adapters'
own retry and auth behaviour is testable too.

The **smoke eval** is deliberately not a test. The tests check units; the eval checks the
assembled agent against a task. It catches the class of breakage where every unit passes and the
whole thing still does nothing.

## Layout

Three packages, following Tau. The rule that decides which one a file belongs to is a single
question: **what does this thing know about?**

```

`omega_agent/session/` is the only subfolder any of them earned — which is also true of Tau, whose
entire agent core has exactly one, and it is this one. Folders follow subsystems.

**Where a file goes, when it is ambiguous:** `hooks.py` is core because the loop *declares* the
callbacks it will consult. Everything that *fills* one — `approval.py`, `redact.py`, `history.py` —
is application, because each is a decision, and the loop asks rather than decides.

### The check that the layering held

It used to be a `grep` in this README. It is now a test:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_layers.py -q
```

which asserts that `omega_agent` imports nothing above it, that `omega_ai` does not know the app
exists, that only a composition root names a concrete provider, and that exactly two files import a
vendor SDK. It reads imports with `ast` rather than text, because all three packages *mention* each
other in their docstrings while importing none of them.

The stronger version of the same check is in the git history. Adding the second provider — a
genuinely different wire format, with the opposite rule about how tool results are sent — required
changes to the adapter package, its tests, and a few lines of provider selection in `cli.py`.
Nothing else moved: not the loop, not the interface, not either event vocabulary. `git show ac0e370`
has the full accounting.

## Why it's shaped this way

Every design decision traces to a document in [`../docs/`](../docs/) — in particular
`03-architecture/04-boundaries-and-layout.md` for the layer rules,
`03-architecture/02-beginner.md` for the nine failures each layer exists to fix, and
`01-teardown/` for where each pattern came from in Pi and Tau.

The nine-failure scorecard is the quickest way to see which tier this is:

| Failure | Fixed in |
|---|---|
| one big output kills the session · nothing appears until it finishes · no turn limit | Tier 1 |
| Ctrl-C corrupts the conversation · it deletes something you wanted · one rate limit ends the run · two edits lose data · no persistence | **Tier 2** |
| switching providers means a rewrite | Tier 1 built the seam · **Tier 2 proved it** |
| context fills up and dies · it costs more than it should | Tier 3 |
